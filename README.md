# PlantDiseasePrediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can detect plant diseases by analyzing leaf images. The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and leverages deep learning techniques to classify the condition of a plant leaf as either healthy or affected by various diseases.
